As a result allows the viewers to understand the contents in which it entails. The author does this by utilizing what is known as *HTML* (Hyper Text Markup Language) to create links that grants viewers the ability to move smoothly from one page to another 'quicker and easier'. The HTML code is made up of characters that live inside angle brackets known as HTML element
