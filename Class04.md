Links:
Writing Links ***Many people navigate websites by scanning the text for links. Clear link text can help visitors find what they want. To write good link text, you can think of words people use when searching for the page that you are linking to.

Linking through other sites Links are created using the element which has an attribute called href. When you link to a different website, the value of the href attribute will be the full web address for the site.

Layout:
Key Concepts in positioning elements

Building Blocks start on a new line -Block level elements -Inline element flow in between sorrounding text

Containing Elements the outer box; is always the direct parent of that element

Controlling Elements:

Normal Flow each block level element sits on tolp of the next one
Relative Positioning moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow
Absolute Positioning the box is taken out of normal flow an no longer affects the postion of other elements on the page
Fixed Positioning is a type of absolute positioning that requires the position property to have a value of fixed
Overlapping Elements the element that appears in the HTMl code sit on top of those that are earlier in the page
Floating Element allows you to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the left or right of the containing element as possible.
Clearing Float allows you to say that no elemeny should touch the left or right hand sides of a box.
Multiple Style Sheet
*** Some web page authors split up their CSS style rule into separate style sheets.

Your HTML page can link to one style sheet and that stylesheet can use the @import rule to import other style sheets
In the HTML you can use separate element for each style sheet.
