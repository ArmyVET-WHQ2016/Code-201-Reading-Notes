Basic of HTML, CSS, JS

# Why Does it matter
As we have learned in previous chapter creating a web page, requires proper use of HTML, CSS, and of course Javascript. Adding tags known as markup to the contents of the page does just that. Tags provide allows the browser to show the users the structure for the page by providing extra meaning. (Duckett, 2011) provides the following examples

 - <sup>
contains characters that should be superscript such as suffixes of dates or mathematical concept
  
 - <sub>

 - <br/> line break
  use if you want to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph
 
 - hr/>

 Introducing CSS 
  
 CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. Which governs how the content of specified elements should be displayed. 
  
 Rules of CSS contains
  1. Selector
  Indicate which element the rule applies to. 
  
  2. Declaration 
  - Indicate how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled. 
  - Are split in two parts that sits inside of curly brackets and are separated by a colon.
    1. A property indicates the aspect of the element you want to change
      2. A value specify the settings you want to use for the chosen properties 
  
  Using External CSS
  
  <link>
  tells the browser where to find the CSS file used to style the page
  
  href specifies the path to the CSS file
  
  type specifies the type of document being linked to 
  
  rel specifies the relationship between the HTML page and the file its is linked to 
  
  <style>
  sits inside of the <head> element of the page.
