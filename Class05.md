*Why this topic matters as it relates to what you are studying in this module*.
In my opinion the whole idea of creating an effective web page is to capture the attention of its viewers by providing the viewer the interest through layout, colors, and positioning to move further into in the content that you have displayed. 

**Learning CSS**

1. What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?
*** alt is for use in situations where the image cannot be seen and displayed or takes a long time to render because of a slow internet connection. There is one way to test if your alt is working properly that is by misspelling teh filename ' the browser in return will not display the image and would the text instead.*** 
2. How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document? 
- The use of **decoration** for this image you must use HTML , add a blank alt="". 
- Providing significant **content** information provide the same information in a brief alt text or  in the text which can be seen.
- Accessibility can be achieved by putting the image inside of <a> tags. to turn an image into a **link** and accessible link text.
- **Text** should be put into images which shouuld do this inside the alt attribute
